# Gazoomia Development Test

Gazoomia is a NFT Marketplace where you will be able to look for trending nfts and buy/sell your NFTs from all different marketplaces such as Looksrare, Opensea, Solart, etc.

## Statement:

Goal in this test is to populate Bored Ape Yatch Club collection assets, displaying all possible traits and being able to filter assets by those traits.

● Write a simple page where you can have a dropdown menu for each trait ( background, eyes and so on ) just as opensea does, showcasing the number of items for each trait. Filtering inside every trait is not needed

● Showcase assets that match with selected traits

##Considerations:

● You can use any API to achieve this goal as long as data is not hardcoded.
● We DON'T/CAN'T provide Api keys due to privacy, if you have for example OpenSea's API key, use it with env variables and we will run it with our API key.

##Evaluation:
One of the main tasks for a blockchain developer is to be able to create bridges between blockchain
data and end-user data, pulling information and displaying it nicely.
For this evaluation it is not important to have a great user interface in terms of design, but to have a
coherent, working and functional interface that allows users to work and view data.

##Plus:
Completing the task without using any Third Party API but pulling directly from a node.
